# Species_Classification
Attempt to use CNN to classify three species.
A sparse data set of only 422 images were taken.
Images were sorted and placed in train test and validation folders.
Each folders contains 3 sub folders Species A, SpeciesB and SpeciesC.
Keras was used the classification category flowed from the directory.
**In the first attempt a very low accuracy of 33% was obtained**.
**In the second attempt a reasonable accuracy of 58 and a highest of 66% was obtained.**
Further improvement and paramter tuning are still going on.
Please Note: The training was done in a CPU without using GPU so there is a very high chance of getting better accuracy with GPU.
The data set is hosted in Sciebo and if anyone insterested can contact me.
